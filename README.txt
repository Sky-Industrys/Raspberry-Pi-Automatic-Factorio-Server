Hardware/Software used:

Raspi 4B w/ official 15W power supply
Factorio headless server for Linux
Unattended Upgrages
Built-in Linux programs (bash, crontab)

To start, the server was set up according to the Factorio Wiki's Multiplayer page (https://wiki.factorio.com/Multiplayer).
Once the unzipped file for the headless server (free download from https://www.factorio.com/download) was on the Raspi and in /opt/factorio, a non-root user was created to protect the Pi from external attacks (good practice, although many "good practice" steps were likely skipped)
